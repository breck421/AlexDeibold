    <h1>About</h1>

	<p>My name is Alex Deibold, and I am a snowboarder. </p>
	<p>Growing up I always loved the outdoors and 27 years later it’s still hard for me sit still, even for a moment. I can’t even remember a time before being on snow. I started early, skiing at age 2 and snowboarding at 4, in the Green Mountains of Southern Vermont.  </p>
	<p>When I was 8 I entered and won my first competition, a slope style at Bromely Mountain, and the hook was officially set. At 13 I was noticed by some of the local coaches and was invited to apply to Stratton Mountain School. A year and a half later my life would change forever when I was fortunate enough to enroll full time in one of the most elite snowboard programs in the world. </p>
	<p>Early on I was mainly a freestyle rider, but thankfully to ensure I was a well-rounded rider, my coaches forced me to train and compete in all 5 disciplines. In 2004 I finished 4th at the Grand Prix in Mammoth, California which earned me a spot on the inaugural US Snowboarding boardercross team. 10 years later I’m still following winter around the world in search of the next adventure.</p>
	<p>In the offseason I pay the bills and feed my addiction to mountain biking by working at a locally owned bike shop in Boulder, Colorado, which I am lucky enough to call home. I keep busy camping, rock climbing, backpacking, and fly fishing as often as I can.</p>
	<p>Life on the road as a professional snowboarder isn’t always all it’s cracked up to be, but there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t appreciate how lucky I am to be chasing my dreams and doing what I love.</p>
